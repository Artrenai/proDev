			<dd>
				I have a hard time believing in myself. It becomes a block for me. I have to motivate myself and not think
				of all the negativity

			<dd>Im new to New Mexico, I dont many people. Tomorrow Im going to see some rentals. Its messing up my goals
				for the next couple of months. Other than that I've
				been blessed. Im a nice person, a genuinely nice person. I'm very laid back and empathetic. When people go
				in a negative direction, I go in a positive direction Im able to understand
				a situation and be empathetic. All the people who dont know me have told me im awesome. The people who do
				know me devalue how hard i work in turn i devalue my own progress because the results are not immediate
